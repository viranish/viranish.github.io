# Print in Place

* Description: Print in place designs are made of multiple components that will function after printing. The process requires no post processing or post assembly. While this can be designed through single material extrusion, by allowing clearance between joints where motion is expected, it can also be done by printing a second, more elastic material.
* Application example: NASA created a print in place ratchet wrench.

* The Knick Finger is a prosthetic print in place finger. Citation: “THE KNICK FINGER.” Enabling the Future, 2 May 2016, enablingthefuture.org/the-knick-finger/.
* What material combinations work well: PLA and TPU, PLA amd PVA, ABS and HIPs

# Discussion

* **Design and Iterative Process** PLA was used for the jaws and handle of the pliers, while the middle, elastic part was printed using TPU. The spring component was the middle. At first the triangular pattern connecting the pieces was too small, so the pieces did not stay attached. This iteration was also printed at 15 mm, which proved to be too thick. In the next iteration, I reduced the thickness to 10 mm and increased the size of the triangular pattern, while the offset size remained the same (0.1 mm). This time the pieces fit perfectly.
* **Relevant specifications** The jaw length is 30 mm. The jaw capacity is 4 mm standard and 12.5 mm when stretched. 
* **Print Settings** For the elastic, middle part, the top and bottom solid layers were decreased to 0 and the grid infill pattern was selected.
